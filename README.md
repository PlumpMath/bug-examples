# Strange interaction with react / quiescent?

This is a small project reproducing the issue in [lein-figwheel#136](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel/issues/136).
I wouldn't call it a minimal example, but I hope to be forgiven this transgression.

## Check it out

- well, yeah, start by checking it out. :-)
- `lein run` in one terminal
- `lein figwheel` in another
- Open the webpage and see more instructions there

Thanks for taking the time to take a look, Bruce!

Kind regards, Magnar
